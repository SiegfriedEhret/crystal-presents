## We love Ruby!

* Readable, clear syntax: very little noise
* Consistent: everything is an object, intuitive methods
* Lots of features: blocks, closures, mixins (modules), metaprogramming, operator overloading, string interpolation, regex literals, range literals, easy process execution, batteries-included standard library
* Useful idioms: truthy/falsey, suffix `if` and `unless`, `is_a?`, `responds_to?`, `case`, `@var ||= value`
* No ceremony
* Duck typing

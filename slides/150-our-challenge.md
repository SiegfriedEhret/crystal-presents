## Our challenge

static types + compiled + "Ruby feeling"

Note:
* Statically typed, compiled languages are usually associated with either many type annotations or a lot of boilerplate or ceremony
* They aren't as flexible as dynamically typed, interpreted languages
* We want a language that is statically typed and compiled but feels, in most cases, like a dynamically typed, interpreted language
* Find a sweet spot of flexibility, expressiveness, and safety
* Make the compiler work more (infer types) and the user work less, have fun (no need to use that many type annotations)
* Similar conventions in code organization

## Is Ruby perfect?

* No language is perfect
* Ruby is **interpreted** and **dynamically typed**
* Crystal is **compiled** and **statically typed**
* With Crystal we want a **compiled** and **statically** typed language that retains, as much as possible, all those features we love about Ruby
* But... why do we want a compiled and statically typed language?
